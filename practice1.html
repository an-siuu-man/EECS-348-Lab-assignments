            Hi, I am Ansuman. As I make this webpage, I am a sophomore in <B>Computer Science</B>.
            I am also a part-time mathematics enthusiast and like solving logical problems
            both in coding as well as math. I am interested in pursuing software engineering 
            and software development in the future. I do love going to hackathons because I like
            the pressure and adrenaline rush! Most of my projects are products of hackathons. 
        </p><br>
        <p id = 'content2'>
            Here are a couple of the projects I've worked on, both independently and in a team
            which have helped me develop collaboration skills as well as hard skills:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href = 'https://github.com/an-siuu-man/Word-Search-Game'>Word Search Game</a><br>
                It's a simple game that lets the user create a grid of letters with hidden words in them.
                The user has total freedom for choosing any topic to get the words from (this is made possible
                by using a text generation API!).
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <a href="https://github.com/manees-singh/NeoPyramid">Sentry Turret</a><br>
                This was for Hacklahoma '24. Our team made a sentry turret which uses a radar sensor to detect obstacles
                around it and if it is within range, change elevation of the barrel and shoot rubber bands at the target.
                Here's a demonstration video for it:
            </li><br>
            <video autoplay controls>
                <source src="video.MOV">
                Your browser does not support the video tag
            </video> 
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a href='https:/github.com/an-siuu-man/Playpal-Playlist-Maker'>Playlist Maker</a><br>
                This is a simple web app made using Django, which gives you ten random songs by any artist of your choice.
                I made this for my first ever hackathon, which was HackKU '23!
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p id = 'content2'>That's all for now, folks!</p>
